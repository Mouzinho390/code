# JavaScript All-in-One For Dummies

I am learning JavaScript, React, Vue, Svelte and Node from a book and online resources.

# Gamelet

A starter program for writing JavaScript games.

## Usage

1. Include gamelet.js in an HTML document containing ann element with an id of 'ball'.

```html
<div id="ball">@</div>
<script src="gamelet.js" />
```

2. The script will detect when the left or right arrow jeys are pressed and will move the ball element accordingly.
